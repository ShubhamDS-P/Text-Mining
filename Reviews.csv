0,  I loved the crucial 4GB DDR4 chipset. I didn‚Äôt know it was so easy to install a RAM in a laptop. It‚Äôs so easy that even a beginner can know how to do it with a star screw driver.My inbuilt RAM was of 4 GB which was honestly quite less in the current WFH scenario. I upgraded the RAM and I can feel that the Laptop has became relatively smooth.
1,"  Improved performance of laptop. It will not increase fps in game  drastically but it will alloe you to use apps like discord and browser , Spotify while gaming smoothly.Numbers wise got about 5 fps increase in AAA games  like AC odyssey, GTA5 . Now that windows has more ram to work with windows history works good and Internal GPU gets more ram to use has video memory . this inceases performance in normal desktops apps and smooth video playback.if you have following laptops you can go with itAsus tuf seriesacer nitro serieslenovoegion 504maximum 2666 frequency supported( my case 2400 cause of r5 3550h)Using it for more than 3 weeks now"
2,"  Purchased it for my dell 5577, which had one ram slot empty. The other ram stick runs at 2400mhz. So was skpetical whether this would work with the other stick. Ordered and installed it and there was no issue with compatibility. Both ram sticks now run at 2400mhz. I'm now able to run complex simulations easily because of the increased ram capacity.Purchased a Samsung 980 SSD with the ram, and now my laptop runs better than new!"
3,"  It has been 7 months since I bought and stared using the RAM (Crucial 4GB Single DDR4 2666 MT/s). Now it suddenly stoped working. It surely comes with ""Crucial 10-year limited warranty"" but replacing a RAM is quite a pain. To avail the warranty you have to visit the service center. And there are not as many service centers in India. In most cases it would cost you more to travel to the service center than buying a new RAM stick. It's been a terrible experience with Crucial. I would suggest to go with Samsung. Samsung has a lot of service centers."
4,  Bought this 4GB ram to install in my Dell Vostro 3401 which came with only 4GB RAM. After installing the laptop performance has  improved  a lot.
5,  I was sceptical if these modules are compatible with my HP 15s-du3230tu cause 1. The laptop listing in Amazon mentioned max 16gb RAM and 2. There aRe too many technical specifications need to check for a match. Howere the RAM modules got installed and recognized without any issue and are working very well.
6,"  got it after a little bit of research, was easy to install. Didnt take much time. The effect on laptop was surprisingly great and its working fluently while streaming. !6 gb from 8 gb makes a lot of difference atleast for me."
7,"  RAM Specs:- To get the details about which crucial RAM should be compatible for your device you can check that from Crucial official site using their Crucial System Scanner. So I did for my device and got the recommendation about 8GB RAM version, still I want to use only 4GB RAM version since my laptop has already got the 4GB RAM installed on it.  The 4GB RAM pattern is same like  8GB RAM so picked this one after researching a lot.Installation :- was quite easy, Just open your laptop carefully, follow the proper steps and easily installed this one.Performance:- Till now, it's great... Performance has become smooth, now easily can work with 10-12 chrome tabs open at the same time with other working apps."
8,  Review for 16 GB 2666 MHz RAM model CT16G4SFRA266:Arrived properly. Installed and functioning properly. Running it in parallel with an 8 GB 2400 MHz RAM. (The overall frequency will be 2400 MHz in this case)Note: It's not mentioned here in the Amazon listing or in Crucial's website but this model is Dual-channel enabled. It shows up in HWINFO64.
9,"  In answers section, someone has mentioned it works with Lenovo G500s. But it's wrong it is not compatible with Lenovo G500s.Please correct the answer, simply misguiding buyers. This product does not have return policy."

12,  I had my doubts whether it will support ryzen 5 3500u whose max ram speed is upto 2400mhz. But turns out 2666mhz ram works fine since it is downclocked to 2400mhz. Been using for a month & no issues so far. Ryzen users won't be dissappointed..
13,"  Writing after a week of use , it was very easy to install the ram, though crucial india site doesn't have this ram register when u search for this model number , but it did the work perfectly . I had bought 8 gb stick for 2.4k and its worth it . Laptop now running very smooth all applications are opening fast."

  ¬†I received the RAM today. My HP 15q-ds0006tu had 4GB of RAM. I searched on Crucial website RAM for my laptop and ordered it. It's very easy to install and perfectly detected. Also my laptop didn't ask for boot. Now it's 20GB in total. Packaging was also really good. Amazon never disappointed me regarding delivery. Thank you Amazon and thank you Crucial for the amazing product."
16,"  Crucial is my trusted brand for memory and storage devices. I have been using crucial products for a long time, and this one is no different. Works perfectly fine and product is as described. Go for it."
17,"  The ram was good. The packaging was not good though: it was sent in an envelope instead of a hard box. Also, one side of the OEM packaging came loose.I got it for my Dell laptop, Inspiron 5590. It slotted perfectly and the whole process went on without any hitch. Thanks to Crucial for lightning support in choosing the correct specification and supplier."
18,  My laptop is HP 15q-ds0007tu with 4gb ram and running at 2133MHz. I was really confused which product should i choose and bought this one.Earlier multitasking was not easy and the lap will hang frequently.The delivery came 2 days early and now after installing it applications will open more than twice the speed then it was earlier and can play games more smoothly.Overall i am satisfied and thank Amazon and the seller for this product.
19,  The Ram was Good and compatible with my Acer Nitro 7. Upgraded from 8Gb to 24 Gb using 16Gb Ram.But the packing was too poor. Not even the box for the product was there.  The chances of breaking during the transit are high with such poor packing.
20,  A perfect ram for my dell inspiron 3501 with 2666Mhz. Performance improved now because total i have now 12GB of ram.
21,"  Great Ram. Works as expected. The packaging was however extremely poor(i have attached a snap of the packaging). Rest everything is just great, I have put this ram in my laptop and its working fine since the past 15 days. Will update if I face any issue."
22,"  I have installed 16 GB RAM in Acer 515 51G. From 8 GB to 20 GB. It's running smooth as butter. 40+ tabs on google chrome, outlook, whatsapp, etc. still no lag."
23,"  WORKING DDR4 RAM for my Asus x541ua i3 6006u system.The system had preinstalled 4GB DDR4 Samsung 2400mhz ram, but considering google chrome ram usage, I upgraded it with this DDR4 2666mhz ram module. performance is the same but now ram has free space for more applications to run simultaneously. Soon I will upgrade HDD to 2.5"" SATA III SSD.NOTE: i3 6006u CPU only supports 2133mhz ddr4 ram, so any upgraded ram will run at the same capped speeds."
24,  Good RAM and delivered perfectly by Appario.I have installed it in my Lenovo Ideacenter 510s and it's working perfectly.Go for it.
25,  Good fit for Dell Vostro 3590. much needed for this laptop
26,"  Delivered in 2 days. ""Toogood"" seller is good & responsive.I paired it with 4GB 3200Mhz RAM in my laptop having 2400 Mhz AMD chipset.2666Mhz RAM works fine. Overall clock speed become 2400 Mhz on the laptop.Works fine and without any bluescreen error.Crucial Warranty: Lifetime."
27,"  Please do not waste your time thinking about clock speed 2666 MHz and CL19, this product fits best in the budget.Ram that came with my laptop is CL17. Still felt no differnce. The only issue here is that the original product is in hard plastic [just like most of the earphones] and when the package was delivered, no bubble wrap was used to cover it. This could have led to some damge while the product was being shipped."
28,  I bought it for 14-AM081TU laptop. And it worked perfect. Installed myself.
29,"  Awesome product, My laptop really working superfast after installing 8GB RAM, I had 8GB ram with my laptop Dell, it's was too slow and used to hung like hell, after I have installed another 8GB ram, I'm very happy to use my laptop now. Blindly u can buy and install it, definitely it will improve laptop performance without any doubt."

32,  Added an 8GB stick replacing a 4GB on my Ideapad 330s. Total RAM is 12GB. Easy to install for those who know how to do it. Worked as it should right from the start. A RAM and SSD upgrade is what you can do to your old laptop for a new lease of life to it.
